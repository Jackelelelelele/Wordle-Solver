# Wordle Solver

A sophisticated Wordle game solver grounded in Information Theory. Using an advanced algorithm, it dynamically calculates the expected entropy of each word based on previous guesses, to optimize subsequent guesses. This project also includes an interactive graphical interface in pygame, which displays the 10 best guesses, and the corrosponding expected amount of information gained.
